# Risk Assessment and Monte Carlo Simulation Platform

## Overview
This platform provides a comprehensive risk assessment solution that combines historical analysis, Monte Carlo simulation, and AI-driven remediation strategies. It's designed to help organizations understand and quantify their cybersecurity risks through a data-driven approach.

## Architecture

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, utilizing Material-UI for a modern, responsive interface. Key components include:

- **Summary Component**: The central dashboard that displays:
  - Historical risk analysis
  - Monte Carlo simulation results with visualizations
  - AI-generated remediation strategies

- **RiskMetricsDisplay Component**: Visualizes risk metrics including:
  - Primary Loss Event Frequency (PLEF)
  - Secondary Loss Event Frequency (SLEF)
  - Loss Magnitudes across different categories

### Backend (FastAPI)
The backend uses FastAPI for high-performance API endpoints and includes:

- Risk simulation engine
- Historical analysis processor
- AI-powered remediation strategy generator
- Data processing and validation layers

## Data Flow

1. **Initial Input Collection**
   - User provides organization details:
     - Annual revenue
     - Number of employees
     - Industry sector
     - Geographic location
     - Additional risk factors
   - System validates and processes initial inputs

2. **Dynamic Question Generation**
   - System generates contextual questions based on initial input
   - Questions adapt based on industry and organization size
   - User responses help refine risk assessment
   - Answers feed into risk metric calculations

3. **Industry Analysis**
   - Analysis of industry-specific risk factors
   - Comparison with similar organizations
   - Generation of industry-specific risk scenarios
   - Identification of sector-specific threats and vulnerabilities

4. **Historical Analysis**
   - Query UMD Cyber Events Database for similar incidents
   - Analysis of historical patterns and trends
   - Calculation of base risk metrics:
     - Threat Event Frequency (TEF)
     - Vulnerability (VUL)
     - Primary Loss Magnitude (PLM)
     - Secondary Loss Event Frequency (SLEF)
     - Secondary Loss Magnitude (SLM)
   - Adjustment of metrics based on historical data

5. **Monte Carlo Simulation**
   - Takes refined risk metrics as input
   - Runs 1 million iterations using PERT distributions
   - Accounts for confidence levels in calculations
   - Generates probability distribution of potential losses
   - Calculates key percentiles (P10, P50, P90)
   - Produces visualization of risk distribution

6. **Remediation Strategy Generation**
   - AI analysis of complete risk profile
   - Integration of:
     - Historical analysis results
     - Industry-specific factors
     - Organization size and capacity
     - Current risk levels
     - Simulation results
   - Generation of tailored, actionable strategies
   - Prioritization based on risk reduction potential

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Risk Calculation Approach
- **FAIR Framework**: Adopted the Factor Analysis of Information Risk methodology
- **PERT Distribution**: Used for more accurate modeling of uncertainties
- **Confidence Levels**: Included in all metrics to reflect uncertainty

### 2. Data Structure
- Hierarchical organization of risk metrics
- Separate handling of primary and secondary losses
- Detailed categorization of loss magnitudes:
  - Productivity
  - Response
  - Replacement
  - Competitive Advantage
  - Fines and Judgements
  - Reputation

### 3. Simulation Strategy
- Million iterations per simulation for statistical significance
- Edge case handling in PERT calculations
- Percentile-based reporting for better decision support

### 4. UI/UX Decisions
- Clear separation of historical and simulated data
- Visual representation of probability distributions
- Actionable remediation strategies
- Responsive design for various screen sizes
