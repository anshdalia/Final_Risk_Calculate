        "description": "On September 11, 2020, a class action complaint was filed by Richard Daniele, Richard Goss and Steve Landi (Plaintiffs) against 10UP, Inc. (Defendant) in the Superior Court of the State of California in and for the County of San Francisco.<P><P>According to the complaint, on or about February 24, 2020, Defendant was the target of a massive data breach in which approximately 74,000 SFRERS members were subject to an unauthorized access and exfiltration, theft, or disclosure of their personal identifiable information (PII). Cybercriminals accessed a trove of personal details about SFERS members--such as names, home addresses, dates of birth, designated beneficiary information, 1099-R tax form information, bank account routing numbers, and SFERS website usernames and passwords--stored on one of Defendant's servers. On March 21, 2020, Defendant began notifying affected individuals about the incident. The data breach resulted from Defendant's violation of the duty to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the PII.<P><P>As a result of the breach, Plaintiffs and Class Members now face years of constant surveillance of their financial and personal records, monitoring, and loss of rights. They also suffered invasion of privacy and out-of-pocket expenses.<P><P>Plaintiffs brought the action individually and on behalf of all SFERS members and former members residing in California whose PII was accessed or otherwise compromised in the Data Breach, which, according to the Notice of Data Breach provided by SFERS, occurred on or about February 24, 2020.<P><P>Plaintiffs sought for an order certifying the case as a class action, an order enjoining Defendant from engaging in the wrongful conduct, compensatory and statutory damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.<P><P>On December 8, 2020, Plaintiffs amended their complaint.<P><P>On June 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement.<P><P>Under the terms of the settlement, all class members can receive a $60 cash payment and a year of free credit monitoring and identity theft protection services offered by IDX. Class members who experienced documented data breach-related losses may be able to recover additional compensation. Affected SFERS members can claim up to $1,000 for extraordinary losses related to the breach, including the costs of fraud, identity theft and up to three hours of lost time (compensated at a rate of $25 per hour).<P><P>The aggregate cap on Defendant's aggregate payment obligation is $1.9 million. If Defendant's obligations would otherwise exceed the $1.9 million cap, costs of administration and credit monitoring are paid as a first and second priority, and all other claims, awards, fees, and costs are 'summed and reduced on a pro rata basis' so that the aggregate cost amounts to $1.9 million.<P><P>Lastly, Class Counsel will receive an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in an amount not to exceed $500,000, plus litigation costs of $16,116.81. Plaintiffs will be given service awards in the amount not to exceed $10,000 each.<P><P>On June 27, 2023, the Court preliminarily approved the class action settlement.<P><P>On November 20, 2023, a motion for final approval of class action settlement was filed.<P><P>On January 18, 2024, the Court granted the motion for final approval of class action settlement.",

(Defendant) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida. The action case was brought in relation to Defendant's alleged breach of contract resulting to exposure of its customers' confidential information, including protected health information (PHI).<P><P>According to the complaint, on December 16, 2020 and January 20, 2021, threat actors targeted Defendant's File Transfer Appliance (FTA) as a means of committing an unauthorized access and theft of confidential information. Upon information, The University of Miami (Insured) used Defendant's FTA software to transfer large files including confidential information and PHI. During the breach, Insured's confidential information was accessed and stolen by threat actors. As a result, Insured incurred damages to remediate the effects of the breach and loss of confidential information, including protected health information.<P><P>Upon learning of the incident, Defendant reportedly investigated and identified vulnerabilities within FTA. On December 20, 2020, Defendant purportedly released a patch to remediate the vulnerabilities to some customers. However, threat actors had already exploited the vulnerabilities, thereby allowing them to exfiltrate confidential information. On January 12, 2021, Defendant released a statement acknowledging the vulnerability in the FTA and that they have resolved the vulnerability and released a patch within 72 hours to the less than 50 customers affected. Despite knowing the vulnerability in the FTA and the exploitation of that vulnerability on December 16, 2020, Defendant did not report that vulnerability or its exploitation to its customers on December 17, 2020 - thereby allowing its clients to terminate their use of FTA and protect themselves against a breach.<P><P>Plaintiff is contractually, legally and equitably subrogated, to its insureds' rights against Defendant to recover for the amounts paid as a result of the loss, as well as to pursue any uninsured losses suffered by virtue of an assignment of such claims, if any. Plaintiff continues to incur losses due to the vulnerabilities in Defendant's systems and failure to timely acknowledge and remedy those vulnerabilities.<P><P>Plaintiff sought for a judgement to be entered against Defendant, interest, attorney's fees, costs, other damages incurred by Insured, and further relief as the Court deems equitable and just.<P><P>On March 4, 2022, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's complaint as it fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.<P><P>On March 25, 2022, amended complaint was filed by Plaintiff.<P><P>On April 7, 2022, Defendant filed a motion to dismiss Plaintiff's amended complaint.<P><P>On June 16, 2022, having considered Defendant's motion, the Court granted in part wherein, Plaintiff's counts II and III of the amended complaint are dismissed.<P><P>On November 3, 2022, Plaintiff filed its second amended complaint against Defendant.<P><P>On December 15, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendant have reached a settlement. According to reports, Defendant offered Plaintiff a $2,500 payment to resolve all claims against the company. Plaintiff accepted the offer, which exposed it to attorney-fee shifting in the event of a loss at trial.<P><P>On December 19, 2022, Plaintiff and Defendant stipulated to dismissed all claims with prejudice. Each party will bear its own attorneys' fees and costs. On December 20, 2022, the Court dismissed the case with prejudice. Thus, the case is closed.<P>",

(Defendant) in the State Court of Fulton County, Georgia. The action arises out of Defendant's negligence allowing a date breach to occur.<P><P>On December 7, 2021, Defendant became aware of suspicious activity on its networks. Defendant immediately investigated to determine the nature and scope of the suspicious activity. The investigation concluded that an unauthorized person obtained access to some of Defendant's systems on December 7 and December 8, 2021, and copied a subset of files out of its network. In addition, Defendant also discovered evidence of an unrelated incident of unauthorized access that occurred on October 6 and October 7, 2020.<P><P>On December 5, 2022, Defendant notified affected individuals stating that the compromised personally identifiable information (PII) included individuals' names, Social Security numbers, driver's license numbers, financial account numbers, and information related to employees' healthcare benefits. Defendant also added that approximately 37,000 individuals were affected. As a result, Plaintiffs and the Class members suffered loss and damages including out-of-pocket expenses, lost or diminished value of PII and increased risk to their PII.<P><P>Plaintiffs sought for an order certifying the case as a class action, statutory damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.<P><P>In December 2023, the parties have reached a settlement agreement.<P><P>Under the settlement terms, class members can claim up to $500 for out-of-pocket costs. Class members may also submit claims for up to three hours of lost time, at a rate of $20 per hour. For those who suffered identity theft due to the breach, the settlement allows for claims up to $3,500 for documented expenses related to the theft.<P><P>The proposed Settlement also provides three years of credit monitoring service free of charge to Settlement Class Members who submit a valid Claim Form.<P><P>In addition, Plaintiffs' counsel will receive Attorneys' Fees and Expenses in the amount of $235,000. Plaintiffs will also receive Service Awards in the amount of $2,500 each.<P><P>On January 18, 2024, the Court preliminarily approved the class action settlement.<P><P>On April 21, 2024, Plaintiffs filed their motion for final approval of class action settlement.<P><P>On May 21, 2024, having reviewed the parties' settlement, the Court granted the final approval of class action settlement. Accordingly, the Court dismissed the case with prejudice and without costs except that the Court reserves jurisdiction over the consummation and enforcement of the Settlement.",

A review of the compromised email accounts revealed they contained the protected health information of 353,616 patients, including names, dates of birth, account/medical record numbers, medical information such as diagnosis and treatment information and, for some individuals, Social Security numbers and health insurance information.  <P> <P>Patients affected by the breach were notified by mail starting October 9, 2020 while the incident was still being investigated, then further notifications were sent to patients between January 21 and February 8, 2021 when it became clear that more individuals had been affected. <P> <P>Following the breach, the health system implemented additional security measures to prevent further breaches and retrained the workforce on how to identify suspicious emails. Individuals whose Social Security number was exposed were offered complimentary credit monitoring and identity theft protection services for 12 months. <P> <P>A law firm Morgan & Morgan filed the suit with Einstein Healthcare patient Nanette Katz of Blue Bell, PA named as lead plaintiff. Plaintiff alleges Einstein Healthcare failed to secure and safeguard the protected health information of patients and had not implemented or followed basic security procedures. As a result of that negligence, the lawsuit alleges sensitive patient information is now in the hands of cybercriminals and patients now face a substantial risk of identity theft. As a result of the breach, patients have had to spend, and will continue to have to spend, a significant amount of time and money protecting themselves against identity theft and fraud.  <P> <P>The plaintiff also alleges the healthcare provider failed to provide timely notifications to patients, with the lead plaintiff first receiving notification about the breach in January 2021, more than 6 months after the breach and alleged theft of her PHI. The lawsuit says the breach response was 'untimely and woefully deficient, failing to provide basic details concerning the data breach.' <P> <P>Plaintiff sought for monetary damages for the patient and class members, requests the courts order the health system to fully disclose details of the nature and extent of data compromised, and requires the health system to implement reasonably sufficient safeguards to prevent further data breaches in the future.<P><P>Morgan & Morgan stood as an ally to those impacted by the breach, and we filed a class-action lawsuit that reached a $2 million verdict on behalf of the victims.",

However, because Google's implementation of GAEN allows a sensitive contact tracing data to be placed on a device's system logs and provides dozens or even hundreds of third parties access to these system logs, Google has exposed GAEN participants' private personal and medical information associated with contact tracing, including notifications to  <P>Android device users of their potential exposure to COVID-19. <P> <P>According to the complaint, on December 2020, California's Contact Tracing App (CA Notify) was downloaded and installed on Plaintiff's android device manufactured by Samsung on Verizon's mobile network, and all systems settings required for CA Notify to function on his device were enabled. In the interest of preserving his medical privacy, Plaintiff did not here recite his COVID-19 status, but stated that if he had been positively diagnosed with COVID-19, he would have entered his diagnosis into the CA Notify App. If Plaintiff had learned what he now knows about the security of information transmitted by Google's System through CA Notify, he would not have downloaded the app or used it the way he did. System log files from Plaintiff's phone have been received and read by third parties, including Samsung and Verizon. Plaintiff have suffered avoidable invasion of privacy, violations of his dignitary rights, and other significant damages as a result of Google's conduct. Upon belief, there are impracticable similarly situated individuals because the Nationwide and California Classes each encompass millions of individuals, dispersed throughout the United States and California, respectively. Defendant's actions allegedly violated the CCMIA. <P> <P>Plaintiff and all others similarly situated sought for an order determining that the action may be maintained as a class action, judgement against Defendant for Plaintiffs' and Class Members' asserted claims for relief, equitable and injunctive relief, enjoining Google from including, continuing to copy, and allowing unauthorized parties access to Plaintiffs' and Class Members' personal and medical information to the system logs, requiring Google to ensure that all personal and medical information acquired, created, or otherwise obtained from the system logs is destroyed, statutory damages, punitive damages, exemplary damages, pre-judgement and post-judgement interest, reasonable attorney's fees and costs reasonably incurred,  and any other relief as the Court deems just and proper.<P><P>On May 6, 2022, a motion for preliminary settlement approval was filed. The Class Counsel will apply for an award of attorneys' fees and reimbursement of expenses in a total amount not to exceed $2 million and based upon their preliminary review, Class Counsel's accrued lodestar is approximately $899,298 based on 1,311.30 of total hours for all relevant timekeepers, and Class Counsel's incurred expenses are approximately $55,349.38. Defendant agrees to pay service awards of $2,500 for each of the two class representatives.",

        "description": "On December 30, 2020, Tracy McPherson (Plaintiff) filed a class action complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma against American Bank Systems, Inc. for its failure to properly secure and safeguard Plaintiff's highly-sensitive, personally-identifiable information.<P><P>According to the complaint, in early November 2020, the group purporting to be behind the Avaddon malware attacks published a 'leak warning' claiming that they had hacked Defendant and taken possession of over 50 gigabytes of data. The group demanded a ransom in exchange for release of the data, coupled with a threat of public disclosure. Avaddon posted that Defendant 'do not want to pay and think that we are bluffing.' The group contemporaneously leaked four gigabytes of the stolen data. Analysis by one news outlet indicated that the sample leak included a variety of highly sensitive information, such as loan documents, login credentials for financial institutions' internal-file-sharing networks, and financial records. In turn, some of the leaked financial documents included banking customers' PII, including names, social security numbers, loan amounts, interest rates, and pertinent loan dates such as origination dates, maturity dates, and pay-off dates. Astonishingly, much of this sensitive data appears to have been stored by Defendant in unencrypted, plain-text files meaning that anyone who gained access to the files could fully read the information (and sensitive PII) therein. Avaddon posted a screenshot of some of the data that was obtained from Defendant and leaked to the public, Defendant's financial-institution customers, including Peoples Exchange Bank of Monroeville, is identified by Avaddon in a screenshot listing the banks and the data that it obtained and leaked. The article indicated that, based on timestamps on screenshots of the leaked files, the breach initially began 'sometime in or before early October.' Defendant apparently did not pay the ransom, and by November 14, 2020, the full gigabytes of stolen data, including Plaintiff's and the Class Members' PII, in the Avaddon group's possession, was leaked publicly. Avaddon also posted a screenshot of the PII, such as customers' names, Tax ID numbers (likely Social Security Numbers), and loans from, Defendant, that was exposed by this breach.<P><P>Plaintiff sought an award for statutory damages, award of costs of litigation and reasonable attorney's fees and all other relief as may be just and proper.<P><P>On June 29, 2021, settlement agreement and release were made. Under the Settlement, Defendant has agreed to pay $1,700,000 into a Common Fund which will be used to pay all Plaintiff/Settlement Class member distributions, and any Court-approved reasonable Plaintiffs' attorneys' fees and expenses, Settlement Administrator's costs and expenses, and Plaintiffs' Service Awards up to $1,500 to each Settlement Class Representative. Two types of claims may be made: 'Documented Loss Claims' and 'Inconvenience Claims.' A Settlement Class Member may make one or both types of claims. The different types of claims are explained later in this notice.<P><P>On June 16, 2022, Plaintiff filed an unopposed motion for final approval of class action settlement. Accordingly, the Court approved Plaintiff's motion. In line with the approval, the Court awards Class Counsel $510,000 as an award of reasonable attorneys' fees and $16,946.57 in expenses to be paid out of the Common Fund in accordance with the Settlement.<P><P>The Final Approval Hearing will be held on July 29, 2022.",

A fault in the system that regulated airflow to the shed prevented another tunnel ventilation system from opening, turning the shed into a sealed unit.<P><P>The temperature inside the shed rose rapidly, causing the birds to suffer heat stress. An investigation into the incident by Leicestershire County Council found that an alarm that should have been set to sound when the temperature inside the building reached 27oC (80.6oF) had been incorrectly set to go off at 37oC (98.6oF). By the time staff at the farm were alerted to the problem, more than half the chickens (27,249) had died.<P><P>The firm was fined at Leicester Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, April 27, 2022.

The action arises out of Defendant's failure to provide fair, reasonable, or adequate computer systems and data security practices to safeguard sensitive personally identifiable information (PII).<P><P>According to the complaint, on or about September 4, 2020, Defendant began notifying individuals that on January 8, 2020, they received a report of unusual activity relating to an employee's Artech user account. A subsequent investigation determined that an unauthorized actor gained access to certain of Defendant's computer systems between January 5, 2020 and January 8, 2020. Defendant's investigation determined that information accessed and acquired during the data breach potentially included the following: names, Social Security numbers, medical information, health insurance information, financial information, payment card information, driver's license/state identification numbers, government issued identification numbers, passport numbers, visa numbers, electronic/digital signatures, usernames and password information.<P><P>Plaintiff's data maintained on Defendant's computer systems and subject to the data breach. Even though Defendant was storing sensitive PII that it knew was valuable to criminals, and vulnerable to exfiltration, Defendant failed to take security precautions necessary to protect Plaintiff's and Class Members' data. Because Defendant failed to take necessary security precautions, Plaintiff's and Class Members' unencrypted PII was accessed and acquired by an unauthorized person or persons as a result of the Data Breach. As a result, Plaintiff and Class Members have been harmed and face an increased risk of future harm.<P><P>Plaintiff sought for a class certification, injunctive and other equitable relief, monetary relief, including actual damages, punitive damages, treble damages, statutory damages, exemplary damages, equitable relief, restitution, and disgorgement, pre- and post-judgement interest, attorneys' fees and costs and further relief as the Court deems necessary, just, and proper.<P><P>On July 8, 2021, the parties have reached a settlement in principle. Accordingly, the parties requested the Court to stay the case pending determination of their planned motions for preliminary and final approval of a contemplated class-wide settlement.

Cash compensation is also available for Class Members who experienced fraud as a result of the data breach.<P><P>In Tier One Compensation, Defendant will pay aggregated caps of $80.00 for lost time at a rate of $26.67 per hour, capped at three hours. In Tier Two Compensation, up to $10,000 in out-of-pocket losses resulting from the data breach. It includes losses as a result of identity theft or other fraud enabled by stolen data. These payments are available for any claimant who provides documentation of time spent addressing the data breach.

The attack was identified late night on November 24, 2020. By the next morning, students and teachers had lost access to everything they depended on for school.<P><P>The district has said no personal information was stolen but has not disclosed the extent of the attack nor any ransom demands.<P><P>Hackers seized control of county school district systems the day before Thanksgiving, forcing the district to cancel online classes for two days.<P><P>Among the largest expenditures was more than $2 million to move computer applications to a cloud-based system and more than $1.4 million for a one-year license on Windows security software, the latter of which was purchased at the strong recommendation of the system's cyber insurance carrier.<P><P>During a county school board meeting Tuesday, George Sarris, the school system's executive director for fiscal services, projected the final price tag could top more than $8 million. Sarris was not available for comment this week.<P><P>The school board previously approved four contracts representing $1.7 million in services related to the ransomware attack.<P><P>The updated figure places the county much closer to what Baltimore City spent on recovery from its own ransomware attack in 2019. The city spent about $10 million on recovery efforts, not including $8.2 million in lost revenues such as taxes, fees, and fines.<P><P>Unlike the city, the Baltimore County school system was paying for cyber insurance at the time of the attack. The system's policy covers up to $2 million for direct costs caused by the ransomware attack and $3 million for liability costs.<P><P>Some of the remaining bills can be paid out of the system's current budget and federal CARES Act funding, Sarris said during a school board budget committee meeting in April.<P><P>Still, the attack has delayed at least one major project school staff were working on this year.<P><P>Another major system lost in the attack was the timekeeping program that allows the district to track employee hours and overtime. Officials estimate it will cost $800,000 to restore the system.<P><P>As of November 12, 2021, the cost of the ransomware attack is almost $9.7 million. The money has been spent in a number of areas to repair the damage and make the computer system safer. The big-ticket item is $2 million to move data to the cloud.<P><P>According to the spokesperson for the district, they have targeted their resources to focus on rebuilding and strengthening the systems. Their work continues however they have established several new processes and security measures over the last year.",

This statement was distributed among several employees of Banca Transilvania on work e-mail addresses. One of the employees listed the e-mail containing the customer's statement, as well as the e-mail containing the internal conversation between the operator's employees. Another employee photographed the listed document with his mobile phone and distributed it through the WhatsApp application. Subsequently, the listed document was posted and distributed on the social network Facebook and on a website. <P> <P>This situation led to the disclosure and unauthorized access to certain personal data (name and surname, e-mail addresses, behavioral data, personal preferences, financial transaction value, place of work, position and place of work, telephone number service ) of 4 targeted individuals (one client and 3 own employees), although according to art. 5 lit. f) of the General Regulation on Data Protection, the operator had the obligation to respect the principle of integrity and confidentiality of personal data. <P> <P>The disclosure produced in the public space also proves the inefficiency of the internal training of the operator's employees regarding the observance of the personal data protection norms of the data subjects, although the employee training is an intrinsic part of the technical and organizational measures that the operator was obliged to adopt. security corresponding to the processing risk, thus violating the provisions of art. 32 of the General Data Protection Regulation.",

The data security incident resulted in the encryption of certain of their network systems. Encryption of systems is typically a defining characteristic of a ransomware attack. On May 24, 2021, they were made aware that certain information had been exfiltrated from their environment by an unauthorized person. They immediately launched an investigation, and a cyber security firm was engaged to assist.<P><P>Plaintiff brought the action on behalf of himself and all persons residing in the United States whose PII was compromised in the data breach. <P><P>Plaintiff sought for class certification, equitable and injunctive relief, actual, nominal, consequential, and punitive damages, attorneys' fees, costs and litigation expenses, prejudgment interest, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper. <P><P>On September 28, 2022, the Accounting firm Bansley & Kiener agreed to pay $900,000 to resolve claims it mismanaged a 2020 data breach.",

The accused hacked into their systems and carried out unauthorised transactions,' a police officer said.<P><P>'Since a hardware wallet and passphrase was required for bitcoin transactions, it was suspected that the culprit was someone proficient in using this technology, and who was closely associated with the firm. Police prepared a list of former employees of the company, and short-listed Ayushi. When questioned, she admitted to have carried out the transactions by acquiring the passphrase written on paper,' the senior police officer added.<P>",

However, the Garante explained that the debt collection calls in question concerned a loan for which the complainant's spouse did not act as guarantor. Subsequently, the Garante indicated that Findomestic Banca had explained that the contested facts had been the result of an internal misunderstanding which had caused the inclusion in the system of the spouse's telephone number as the main contact for debt collection.<P><P>After further investigations, Garante found that Findomestic Banca had violated the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency, and data minimization. Notably, the Garante highlighted that it had clarified, with a general order dated November 30, 2005, that anyone processing personal data in the context of debt collection activities must comply with the principle of lawfulness of the processing, which is violated in case of unjustified communications to third parties (such as family members and work colleagues) concerning a debtor's arrears.",

The incident was the biggest attack of its kind in France.

Then, they tell the person they want to manipulate that the company is about to buy another company and it's confidential. The person who made the transfers was fired for serious misconduct.<P><P>For the case of CDER, the crooks stated that the transaction was carried out under the control of the financial market's authority.

The investigation into the attack revealed the attacker had gained access to its systems following a response to a spear phishing email sent on April 6. An employee of Defendant inappropriately responded to the email phishing scheme, allowing unauthorized actors to gain access to the employees' email accounts.<P><P>On or about May 12, 2020, Defendant notified affected persons and various governmental agencies of the breach. At least 163,654 individuals were impacted by the breach. Information compromised in the breach included names, contact information, employee ID numbers, and W-2 or 1099 information, including Social Security numbers or taxpayer identification numbers, treatment information, health insurance account information, member IDs, other health-related information, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, and additional PII.

'The scope and complexity of the scheme are, however, alarming and remind us all of the importance of keeping our technology protected, as well as the perils of conducting financial transactions with -- or on behalf of -- individuals unknown to you.'<P><P>According to Stollsteimer , thieves attempted to steal a total of $13.3 million from the district, but were thwarted when a single $8.5 million payment request sent up red flags and allowed Treasury to claw back $10.3 million before it could be washed through multiple banks and sent overseas.<P><P>Had that gone through, teachers may not have been paid, he added.<P><P>The investigation determined that personal information was compromised as a result of the breach, including names, date of birth, Social Security numbers, and/or health insurance information.<P><P>On July 15, 2021, the District provided notice of the incident to 1,245 affected individuals including 1 Louisiana, 3 Connecticut, 6 New York, 2 North Carolina, 47 New Jersey and 10 Maryland residents.<P><P>The District provided 2 years of complimentary credit monitoring and identity protection services.",

OCR created this initiative to support individuals' right to timely access their health records at a reasonable cost under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.<P><P>OCR launched an investigation on Jan. 3, 2020 and found the failure to provide the parent with timely access to the requested health data was a potential violation of the HIPAA Right of Access standard. The investigation resulted in the patient receiving all requested records from CHMC on June 20 and July 16, 2020.The privacy regulation requires a covered entity or business associate to act on patient access requests within 30 days, or within 60 days if an extension is applicable.<P><P>Children's Hospital & Medical Center (CHMC) has agreed to take corrective actions and pay $80,000 to settle a potential violation of the HIPAA Privacy Rule's right of access standard. CHMC is in Omaha, Nebraska, and provides pediatric health care services.<P><P>In May 2020, a parent filed a complaint with OCR alleging that CHMC had failed to provide her with timely access to her minor daughter's medical records. CHMC provided some records but did not provide all the requested records to the parent's multiple follow-up requests.<P><P>OCR initiated an investigation and determined that CHMC's failure to provide timely access to the requested medical records was a potential violation of the HIPAA right of access standard, which requires a covered entity to act on an access request within 30 days of receipt (or within 60 days if an extension is applicable). As a result of OCR's investigation, the parent finally received all the requested records.<P><P>'Generally, HIPAA requires covered entities to give parents timely access to their minor children's medical records when the parent is the child's personal representative. OCR's Right of Access Initiative supports patients' and personal representatives' fundamental right to their health information and underscores the importance of all covered entities' compliance with this essential right,' said Acting OCR Director Robinsue Frohboese.<P><P>In addition to the monetary settlement, CHMC will undertake a corrective action plan that includes one year of monitoring.",

Dyer said he spoke to a special agent Wednesday evening and learned new information, but there were some details he wasn't sharing so as not to further compromise the federal investigation. 'This was part of a much larger scheme that was occurring,' Dyer said. Dyer spent a large portion of the news conference explaining why his administration didn't reveal the loss earlier, saying it was out of respect for the FBI investigation. He also explained how the Fresno City Attorney's Office handled a December public records request from The Bee and why records were not released. 'There's nothing more that I cherish as a public official, whether that was my time as police chief or now as the mayor, than earning the trust of this community,' he said. 'Once that trust is violated, I lose credibility as the leader of this organization. So, I want to reiterate at no time was there ever an attempt to hide information from the public or to deceive any media outlet on a public records request.' <P><P>The Bee broke the news of the phishing scam Wednesday after Dyer and Fresno City Councilmember Miguel Arias confirmed it. TIMELINE OF EVENTS In the news conference Thursday, Dyer said two payments totaling $613,737 were made in January and March of 2020 through wire transfers. The city received two fake invoices that looked identical to invoices from a city contractor working on the construction of the southeast Fresno police station. The fraud was discovered in April when the contractor threatened to walk off the job due to not receiving payment, Dyer said. The fraud was then reported to the Fresno Police Department, and eventually the investigation was handed over to the FBI in November 2020.",

Staff detected the infection and ransom notification at approximately 6:50am and disabled all network connections to contain the malware spread. Mutual aid from neighboring jurisdictions was brought onsite to assist, and a cybersecurity analyst was contracted to provide forensic investigation and recovery. <P> <P>Preliminary investigation indicates the ransomware entered the City's network through a phishing scam or brute force and looks to be a random attack. <P> <P>Financial data appears to be recoverable from unaffected backups. Personal credit card information was not compromised, as the City uses external PCI-certified payment gateways. There is no evidence to suggest personal data was compromised, but out of an abundance of caution, residents and employees are advised to be vigilant to monitor accounts for suspicious activity. The City sends a security breach notification to individuals who have personal information residing on the City's network. <P> <P>The ransomware that invaded the City's system was used by criminals to block access to the City's computer data until a sum of money is paid. City officials opted to pay $45,000 ransom to retrieve a 'key' to unlock encrypted data rather than risk further delay or damage to the municipality's online operations.",

The Italian SA had already issued a prohibitory injunction against the company, on account of similar infringements that had occurred when the previous data protection law was in force. <P> <P>The fine was imposed following complex investigations and inspections. Complaints were received from users against unsolicited marketing communications made without their consent via texting, emails, faxes, and automated phone calls. In several cases, the complainants had declared they had not been enabled to exercise their right to withdraw consent or object to the processing of their data for marketing purposes, partly on account of the inaccurate contact information provided in the information notices. In yet other cases, users' personal data had been included in public phone listings despite the (at times reiterated) objections made by those users thus violating the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR). <P> <P>The investigation showed that the MyWind and My3 apps had been configured in such a way as to require the user to consent, on each access, to processing for various purposes including marketing, profiling, communication of data to third parties, data enrichment and geolocation; withdrawal of such consent was allowed after 24 hours. <P> <P>The pleadings submitted by Wind Tre and the corrective measures implemented by the company, as also related to the centralized approach applying to marketing campaigns, were found inadequate by the Italian SA, which accordingly fined Wind Tre EUR 16,729,600 (18, 600,000 USD) and prohibited any further processing of the data they had acquired without consent.

According to Russell Goodwin, executive director for the Personnel Cabinet, the fraudulent gift card redemption amounted to a total of $100,000. <P> <P>After the first attack, StayWell took its site down in order to introduce new security enhancements.     <P> <P>The second data breach, occurring from May 12 to 22, was a direct result of the first.

The action arises out of Defendant's failure to properly secure and safeguard personal and sensitive information in violation of the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act (FDUTPA).<P><P>According to the complaint, on or before December 22, 2020, Defendant Humana learned that personal identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI) of approximately 62,000 members had been exposed to unauthorized individuals through personal Google Drive account. Defendant Humana determined that the breach occurred because Defendant Cotiviti, with Humana's authorization and approval, collected the PII and PHI from medical providers and then shared with a subcontractor, Visionary, from October 12, 2020 through December 16, 2020. Thereafter, the PII and PHI was disclosed to unauthorized individuals to promote personal business endeavor.<P><P>Defendant Humana admits that the unencrypted PII and PHI exposed to unauthorized individuals included names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth, treatment related information, and/or actual images (x-ray, photographs, etc.).

As a result of Defendants' negligence, Plaintiff and the Class suffered loss and damages including significant risk of identity theft, lost or diminished value of PII and PHI, out-of-pocket expenses and anxiety.<P><P>Plaintiff brought the action individually and on behalf of all persons in the United States whose PII was compromised in the data breach that is the subject of the Notice of Privacy Incident that Defendant Humana sent on or around March 1, 2021.<P><P>Plaintiff and the putative class sought for an order certifying the case as a class action, equitable and injunctive relief enjoining Defendant from engaging in the wrongful conduct, actual, nominal and consequential damages, attorneys' fees and costs, pre-judgement interest and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.<P><P>On June 17, 2021, the case was removed from the circuit court to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida.<P><P>On February 4, 2022, the parties jointly moved the Court to stay the case pending completion of the mediation.

The settlement also required Defendant Cotiviti to separately pay for all costs for notice to the Settlement Class, Costs of Claims Administration and costs of Dispute Resolution.<P><P>Under the terms of the settlement, class members can receive a maximum of $5,250 in payments for out-of-pocket losses. The settlement allows up to $250 for ordinary losses, such as fees, credit monitoring and three hours of lost time at a rate of $20 per hour. Class members can collect a larger payment of up to $5,000 for extraordinary losses, such as unreimbursed fraudulent charges and identity theft.

Kroll, a division of the consulting firm Duff and Phelps, was retained to resolve the situation, which shut down the library and its services for a few days in late September. <P> <P>According to the report, the investigation determined a 'bad actor' gained access to the library's computer systems and deployed a computer code known as ransomware. <P> <P>Based on investigations by the consulting firm, the ransomware the library experienced had 'historically and typically been interested in revenue accumulation through ransom payments,' instead of collecting sensitive information, like personal or business data that the library may have in its system. <P> <P>The firm reported that no personal data, such as patron information, was accessed or acquired by the threat actor. <P> <P>A negotiation team from the cybersecurity firm Coveware initiated contact with the threat actor, whose initial ransom requested four bitcoin, or approximately $43,000. Coveware was successful in negotiating the number down to 3.36 bitcoin, or $36,000, in exchange for the decryption of the library's software. The team was able to successfully decrypt the library's system and fully restore operations. <P> <P>KHCPL used its cyber insurance policy to cover costs for the incident. In total, the incident cost the KHCPL $4,848, which was paid out of the library's operating fund.",

        "description": "A major electronics manufacturer for defense and communications markets was knocked offline after a ransomware attack, TechCrunch has learned. A source with knowledge of the incident told TechCrunch that the defense contractor paid a ransom of about $500,000 shortly after the incident in mid-January, but that the company was not yet fully operational. <P> <P>California-based Communications & Power Industries (CPI) makes components for military devices and equipment, like radar, missile seekers and electronic warfare technology. The company confirmed the ransomware attack. CPI are working with a third-party forensic investigation firm to investigate the incident. The investigation is ongoing, said CPI spokesperson Amanda Mogin. We have worked with counsel to notify law enforcement and governmental authorities, as well as customers, in a timely manner. <P> <P>According to the source, a 'domain admin', a user with the highest level of privileges on the network clicked on a malicious link while they were logged in, which triggered the file-encrypting malware. Because the thousands of computers on the network were on the same, unsegmented domain, the ransomware quickly spread to every CPI office, including its on-site backups. The source described the company in 'panic mode,' as only about one-quarter of its computers are back up and running as of the end of February. <P> <P>Short staffing is hampering the effort, the source said. Some computers containing sensitive military data have been recovered using the decryption key, which the company obtained by paying the ransom. One system is said to have files related to Aegis, a naval weapons system developed by Lockheed Martin <P> <P>CPI becomes the latest victim in a spate of attacks targeting large companies in the past month.",

On May 20, 2020, ODJFS notified PUA program claimants by email that a security vulnerability in the PUA system designed and maintained by Deloitte allowed third party access to their names, social security number, and home address. Upon belief, there are approximately 38.6 million individuals filed for unemployment.<P><P>Plaintiffs brought the case on behalf of all persons whose personal information was compromised as a result of the PUA portal data breach.<P><P>Plaintiffs sought for the action be certified as class, compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, attorneys' fees, costs, pre- and post-judgment interest, and further relief the Court deems just and proper.<P><P>On June 23, 2020, the Court consolidated the Culbertson, Alexander, Burns, and Neal cases.<P><P>On July 24, 2020, Paul Culbertson, Kathy Neal, Kelly Allison-Pickering, Jessica Haiman, Alexander Cabot, Briana Julius, Nichelle Newland, Bernadette Nolen, and Alexandria Polichena, filed a Consolidated Class Action Complaint, asserting thirteen counts against Deloitte Consulting for its alleged failure to protect Plaintiffs' and class members' personally identifiable information.<P><P>On August 18, 2021, Plaintiffs and Defendant have agreed to enter into a Settlement Agreement to avoid further burden, expense, and uncertainty of protracted litigation.

The proposed order would impose a judgment of $7,700,000 against DMB, which would be suspended upon its paying $5,400,000 in restitution to consumers. <P> <P>CFPB alleged that DMB engaged in deceptive acts or practices in conjunction with its fees and disclosures, violating both the TSR and the CFPA.  To support this claim, the CFPB alleged that  DMB represented to consumers that they would not charge fees for services until settlement payment was made to a creditor yet collected fees in cases where there was either no settlement or the consumer did not make a settlement payment. <P> <P>DMB requested and received fees based on consumers' debt amounts at a point in time after their program enrollment, instead of the debt amount at the time of enrollment. <P> <P>DMB failed to disclose in a clear and conspicuous manner, prior to enrollment, of the time frame by which DMB would make a bona fide settlement offer to a consumer's creditors. <P> <P>DMB's employees also have initiated phone calls to prospective customers in at least 24 states to persuade them to enroll in its debt-settlement programs. <P> <P>In addition to paying monetary relief, DMB must refrain from the deceptive acts or practices alleged in the complaint regarding fees and disclosures and may not use or obtain a consumer's credit report unless for an authorized purpose under the Fair Credit Reporting Act. <P> <P>On May 19, 2021, the case was terminated, and the court has enforced an order.",

        "description": "On January 21, 2021, a class action complaint was filed by Jane Doe (Plaintiff) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division against Easy Healthcare Corporation (Defendant). <P> <P>According to the complaint, Defendant is one of the largest on-line providers of home and workplace healthcare products selling various devices such as thermometers, oximeters, pregnancy tests, drug tests, etc. As part of its business operations, Defendant created and offers an application ('app') for PEDs called 'Premom'4 on the internet and various on-line stores (e.g., Google Play, Apple's App Store) for persons such as the Plaintiff to download free of cost. This app acts as an ovulation tracker, period calendar, and fertility tool. Purchasers of Defendant's healthcare products, like Plaintiff, are encouraged to utilize Defendant's Premom app. Also, users of Defendant's Premom app are solicited to purchase Defendant's healthcare products to assist in their fertility.  <P> <P>Sometime during February 2020, Plaintiff Jane Doe downloaded the Defendant's Premom app onto her One-Plus PED using the Android operating software system while in Virginia and began using this app. Plaintiff had learned about the Premom app when she was purchasing online healthcare products offered by Defendant. Like all others downloading Defendant's Premom app on their PEDs, once this app was downloaded by Plaintiff, the Plaintiff and Defendant entered into and agreed to a 'Terms of Service Agreement' (hereafter 'TSA') provided by Defendant. The TSA or Privacy Policy was drafted solely by the Defendant with no input from Plaintiff or other Premom app users. These agreements emanated from Defendant's Illinois location and were posted on its website and Premom app from there. In this Privacy Policy, the Plaintiff and other app users provide express consent to Defendant to collect, use, and disclose their personal information, but only in the manner described in the Privacy Policy. In the Privacy Policy, the Defendant further states 'you explicitly consent to the following use by us and disclosure by us of your information. When it comes to sharing Plaintiff and other Premom app users' Personal Data, the Privacy Policy II states that Defendant will only 'share Personal Data when we have your consent.  <P> <P>On or soon after August 20, 2020, Plaintiff learned that Defendant had been sharing her and other Premom App users' personal information and location data from their Android operating software system PEDs with three Chinese entities. This data sharing began as of the Premom app's availability for download in 2017. This was being done in secrecy without Plaintiff or other Premom app users' knowledge and consent and in violation of Defendant's Privacy Policies. Three Chinese entities were formed and are located in China. These entities store all the Premom app users' data set forth herein on servers located in China. Under Chinese law, all of this data is accessible by the People's Republic of China, and in turn the Communist Party of China. Defendant deceived the Plaintiff and other Premom app users because, unknowing to them, it directly worked with these three Chinese entities prior to launching the Premom app. Plaintiff estimates that the proposed class includes at least 50,000 persons. <P> <P>Plaintiff sought for damages, judgment, costs and attorneys' fees, punitive damages and all further relief as the court deems just and equitable.<P><P>On May 16, 2023, Plaintiff filed an Unopposed Motion for Preliminary Approval of Stipulation of Settlement Agreement and Release.<P><P>On August 23, 2023, an order granting conditional class certification & preliminary approval of stipulation of settlement was granted by the court. <P><P>Easy Healthcare agreed to pay $750,000 to resolve claims that it shared Premom app user information with third parties without first getting consent.<P><P>The settlement benefits consumers who are registered to use Easy Healthcare's Premom app on their Android or iOS smartphones, tablets or laptops and who purchased a new device due to privacy concerns. <P><P>According to the class action lawsuit, the Premom app shared personal information and device data with third parties without user consent. The app allegedly shared advertising IDs, router IDs, serial numbers and other device data, forcing consumers to get entirely new devices or routers in order to keep their information private.<P><P>On November 13, 2023, deadline for exclusion and objection.<P><P>On December 20, 2023, schedule for hearing for the settlement final approval.",

After the unauthorized user gained access, approximately 2,000 phishing emails were sent from the compromised email account.<P><P>Under the settlement, EyeMed has agreed to implement additional privacy and security measures to improve the protection of consumers' information. EyeMed will comply with the state Consumer Protection Acts, the state Personal Information Protection Acts, and the federal HIPAA law.

According to reports, the criminals exploited as many as four vulnerabilities in Defendant Accellion's FTA to steal sensitive data files associated with up to 300 of Defendant Accellion's clients, including corporations, law firms, banks, universities, and other entities. <P> <P>On March 5, 2021, Defendant Flagstar publicly confirmed that the Personal Information of Defendant Flagstar customers was compromised in the Data Breach, by releasing a statement on its website. On its webpage dedicated to the Defendant Accellion breach, Defendant Flagstar provides scant details regarding the Data Breach. <P> <P>Defendant Flagstar has confirmed that it has stopped using Defendant Accellion's jeopardized FTA services, but unfortunately for Plaintiff and Class members, the damage is already done. On information and belief, Defendant Flagstar failed to make the switch to kiteworks and knowingly continued to use FTA, exposing its customers' (and potentially employees') Personal Information to the risk of theft, identity theft, and fraud. The harm caused to Plaintiff and Class members by the Data Breach is already apparent. The Data Breach creates a heightened security concern for Plaintiff and Class members because SSNs and other banking and tax information was potentially disclosed. <P> <P>Despite the known risk of data breaches and the widespread publicity and industry alerts regarding other notable (similar) data breaches, Defendants failed to take reasonable steps to adequately protect Defendant Accellion's FTA from being breached and to properly phase out the unsecure FTA platform, leaving Defendant Accellion's clients and its clients' customers and employees exposed to risk of fraud and identity theft. Upon information and belief, classes appear to include many thousands of members who are geographically dispersed. <P> <P>Plaintiff sought for actual and statutory damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses and such other favorable relief as allowable under law or at equity.<P><P>On August 2, 2021, Plaintiff filed a notice of settlement.<P><P>On September 3, 2021, Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement.

Of these, 21,860 did not see more fraudulent activity following the unauthorized login. But in the case of 12,700 taxpaying Canadians, their CRA direct deposit information was successfully changed.

Insight Global also cooperated with the United States' investigation.<P><P>As a result of the violation, Insight Global has agreed to pay $2.7 million to resolve allegations that it violated the False Claims Act by failing to implement adequate cybersecurity measures to protect health information obtained during COVID-19 contact tracing.

Hackers obtained information from Kemper and its subsidiaries including personally identifiable information (PII) of thousands of its current or former employees and customers, including, but not limited to, their names, addresses, Social Security Numbers, driver's license numbers, medical leave information, and workers' compensation claim information. Hackers accessed and then either used or offered for sale the unencrypted, unredacted, stolen PII to criminals. Plaintiffs stated that defendants failed to adequately protect its current or former employees' and customers' PII, warn them of their inadequate information security practices, and effectively monitor their websites and platforms for security vulnerabilities and incidents. Upon information and belief, Defendants have identified thousands of customers whose PII may have been improperly accessed in the data breach and are apparently identifiable within defendants' records.  <P> <P>Plaintiff sought for class certification, an order enjoining Defendants from engaging in the wrongful conduct, compensatory, statutory, nominal and punitive damages, reasonable attorneys' fees, costs, and litigation expenses, and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.<P><P>Defendants have proposed to settle the class action stemming from two data breaches in a deal valued at about $17.6 million. The two breaches were believed to have compromised the personal information of an estimated 6.1 million customers and employees. <P><P>The Plaintiffs have accepted the settlement, but it must still be approved by the Court. <P><P>Under the settlement, all affected customers will be provided with automatic access to 18 months of credit monitoring and financial account protection without the need to file a claim. In addition to that, every class member has the opportunity to make a claim for up to $10,000 in reimbursement for out-of-pocket losses. For California class members who alleged violations of California's Consumer Privacy Act, every member can claim additional benefits of up to $50.  <P><P>On December 23, 2021, the Plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion for Final Approval of Class Action Settlement.<P><P>On March 18, 2022, the Court granted the final approval of class action settlement, including attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses in the amount of $2,500,000 and $1,500 to each of the Representative Plaintiffs.

The state did not present any evidence during their investigation, and the insurance company decided to settle.<P><P>According to the Department of Justice, Gustafson was breached in January 21, 2020 by an electronic message that appeared to contain a client's tax information but actually contained malware. Scammers then filed several fraudulent tax returns in clients' names.<P><P>Gustafson identified the malware after a week and removed it from their network, according to settlement documents filed in Multnomah County Circuit Court. But the state stated that Gustafson it took until March 2020 for Gustafson to hire a forensic investigator to assess the damage.<P><P>The state also claimed that Gustafson didn't notify clients until May 2020, five months after the digital intrusion. But the firm didn't actually know the breach came from within their own systems - rather than those of its tax software provider - until its investigation was complete in April 2020, according to Mullaney.<P><P>Gustafson immediately set about reporting the issue and that they, by law, timely notified their clients and all the necessary state and federal authorities. Security of Gustafson clients' information is a top priority.",

The Commission subsequently received a complaint from an individual believed to have been affected in the Incident. <P> <P>On 13 November 2020, a staff member of the Organization received an email from the Domain Provider stating that changes had been made to the settings of the Organization's domain hosting account with the Domain Provider. Staff members also received password reset emails for accounts on the Organization's other file-sharing and office productivity services. As the Organization had not requested the changes, the Organization followed up with the Domain Provider, who acknowledged that the Organization's email accounts on its domain with the Domain Provider were no longer routed to the Organization. As a result of social engineering attacks on employees of the Domain Provider, an employee of the Domain Provider incorrectly transferred control of the Organization's Domain Hosting Account to an external actor. This allowed the external actor to change the registered email address on the Organization's Domain Hosting Account and subsequently affect a password reset on the account to take control of the Domain Hosting Account.<P> <P>According to PDPC Decision, the personal data of 652,564 of the Organization's customers were accessed and exfiltrated in the Incident, comprising the following, First name and surname, Address, Email address, Telephone number, and Photo-image of documents provided by 362,035 customers for KYC purposes before October 13, 2018, namely, NRIC number, passport number or other identification documents, proof of address document, and photograph, Financial information of Japanese customers of Quoine Corporation, a Japanese company related to the Organization, Transaction information, fiat deposits, and crypto withdrawals, and a 2018 record of balances prior to the launch of the current Liquid Exchange and for customers depositing and withdrawing fiat currencies, Bank account, and other information, namely, name of the bank, account number, and name of the account holder.<P><P>The Commission has repeatedly highlighted that an organization should design and organize its security arrangements to fit the nature of the personal data held by the organization and the possible harm that might result from a security breach and implement robust policies and procedures for ensuring appropriate levels of security for personal data of varying levels of sensitivity. As stated in the commission's Advisory Guidelines an organization can use to protect personal data by adopting appropriate access and measures that an organization can use to protect personal data including adopting appropriate access control considering stronger authentication measures where appropriate and installing appropriate computer security settings.<P><P>The Commissioner hereby requires the Organization to pay a financial penalty of SGD$67,000 (US$49,815.8).<P>",

        "description": "Lolland Municipality has been fined DKK 50,000 for not having implemented basic security measures in the form of unavoidable requirements for access codes on the municipality's mobile devices. Betty Husted, deputy in the Danish Data Protection Authority said that municipalities process large amounts of sensitive information about citizens, and therefore they also have a responsibility to look after this information properly. Mobile devices are occasionally stolen, forgotten or lost, and if unauthorized persons can easily access the information on them, then you are not living up to that responsibility. The Danish Data Protection Authority became aware of the situation through a report from Lolland Municipality in December 2020, when an employee in the municipality had a work phone stolen. Via the phone, there was access to the employee's work email account, which contained information about several citizens' names, social security numbers, health information and abuse. The phone was not protected by a code as it was switched off. Therefore, there was access to the information that was on the phone. The municipality stated that over a number of years it had been possible for employees to remove the otherwise mandatory access codes, so that telephones could be used without the use of a code. The municipality had immediately initiated restorative measures in the form of new precautions and changes in the technical set-up of handed out telephones. The Norwegian Data Protection Authority finds that Lolland Municipality's processing of personal data was not in accordance with the rules on adequate security. In the assessment, the Danish Data Protection Authority has, among other things, emphasized that a data controller must assume that not all employees at all times follow internal guidelines that mobile devices must always be protected by a password. Really effective protection is thus dependent on such a password not being bypassed, e.g. in that the individual user can switch off the code. It is also the Danish Data Protection Authority's assessment that, in general, stolen mobile devices are examined for personal data to a greater extent than previously, such as e.g. credit card information and social security numbers before these are disposed of, e.g. on resale.",

The two consumers claimed that Defendant has failed to maintain reasonable security controls and systems appropriate for the nature of the PII it maintains as required by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and other common and statutory laws. Defendant also failed to maintain proper measures to detect hacking and intrusion.<P><P>Plaintiff sought for class certification, compensatory damages, punitive damages, statutory or civil penalties, injunctive or other equitable relief that directs Defendant to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to protect customers' PII that conform to relevant federal and state guidelines and industry norms, reasonable costs and expenses incurred in this action, including attorneys' fees and expert fees, and other relief as the Court may deem just and proper.<P><P>On June 29, 2021, the top-class actions reported that the settlement will provide $5 million to provide compensation and other benefits for Defendant users who were affected by a data breach that occurred on or about May 6, 2020 and resulted in the theft of users' personal identifying information.",

The action arises out of Defendant's failure to properly secure and safeguard protected health information.<P><P>According to the complaint, as one of the largest orthopaedic conglomerates, Defendant collects, stores, and maintains a massive amount of protected health information and other personally identifiable data on its customers and/or patients. As a condition of providing health care services, Defendant requires that its patients entrust it with certain personal information. In its ordinary course of business, Defendant maintains personal information, including the name, address, zip code, date of birth, Social Security number, personal medical information, and protected health information of each current and former patient. Plaintiffs and current and former patients, relied on Defendant to keep their PII confidential and securely maintained, to use the information for business purposes only, and to make only authorized disclosures of the information.<P><P>On or about April 9, 2020, Defendant's computer system suffered a ransomware attack that encrypted the data stored on its servers. Defendant acknowledged that personal information of its patients was exposed during the incident containing personal and protected information, including Plaintiffs' PII (Data Disclosure). On June 18, 2020, Defendant finally publicly revealed the incident to current and former patients. The letter failed to advise of the actual date of the Data Disclosure, only when it was discovered, or why Defendant waited more than two (2) months after discovering the incident to notify patients of the Data Disclosure. Plaintiffs received Defendant's letters on or about June 27, 2020 nearly 3 months after the security incident was discovered.<P><P>Allegedly, Defendants failed to secure Plaintiffs' PII and also failed to adequately investigate the breach to determine the scope and expanse of the breach and failed to notify its patients within a reasonable time. As a result of the delayed response and notification, Plaintiffs and other affected individuals had no idea their PII had been compromised, and that they were, and continued to be, at significant risk to identity theft and various other forms of personal, social, and financial harm. As a consequence of the Data Disclosure, Plaintiffs suffered damages by taking measures to both deter and detect identity theft.<P><P>Plaintiffs brought the case on behalf of themselves and all individuals in the United States who are current or former patients or customers of Defendant, whose PII was exposed and accessed, and who suffered injury or harm resulting from the dissemination of their PII (Class Members).<P><P>Plaintiff sought for class certification, equitable relief enjoining Defendant from engaging in the wrongful conduct, actual, nominal, and consequential damages, attorneys' fees, costs, litigation expenses, prejudgment interest, and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.<P><P>On August 3, 2020, the case was removed from the Circuit Court to the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida.<P><P>On October 8, 2021, Plaintiffs amended their complaint.<P><P>On March 16, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement. Defendant has agreed to pay and create a Settlement Fund of $4,000,000.<P><P>Under the terms of the settlement, class members can receive a cash payment for out-of-pocket loss reimbursement and lost time. Class members can claim up to $15,000 for out-of-pocket expenses. Class members can also claim up to five hours of lost time at $25 per hour.<P><P>The settlement also provides three years of identity restoration services through Aura. Class members can also receive identity theft Protection Services through Aura's Identity Guard Total, which typically retails at $196 per person and includes $1 million in identity theft insurance, credit bureau reports and other features.<P><P>In addition, Class Counsel will receive an award of Attorneys' Fees not to exceed one-third (33.33%) of the Settlement Fund or $1,333,333 and $17,307.21 in litigation costs. Unfortunately, no service/incentive awards will be given to the Plaintiffs.<P><P>On May 16, 2022, the Court preliminarily approved the class action settlement.<P><P>On September 8, 2022, Plaintiffs filed a motion for final approval of class action settlement.<P><P>On November 14, 2022, the Court granted the final motion for class action settlement and entered its final judgment directing to close the case.",

This class action arises out of Defendant for its willful disclosure of its patients' personally identifiable information (PII) and personal health information (PHI).<P><P>According to the complaint, in May 2020, Defendant has engaged in a campaign to encourage its patients to use its digital healthcare platform and tools such as the MyChart patient portal, which allows patients to schedule and attend doctors' appointments, renew their prescriptions, view test results, and access virtual care options. Defendant's campaign involved the use of Facebook advertisements and Facebook's tracking pixels to monitor how patients interacted with Novant's website and patient care portal ('Facebook Pixel'). The Facebook Pixel is a piece of code that 'tracks the people and type of actions they take.' When a user accesses a website hosting the Facebook Pixel, Facebook's software script surreptitiously directs the user's browser to simultaneously send a separate message to Facebook's servers. The information sent to Facebook by Novant includes which pages the patient visits, which buttons are clicked, the specific information users enter forms (e.g., name, home address, phone number, email address), and other information including a patient's IP address.<P><P>Plaintiffs and Class Members were unaware that their PII and PHI were being surreptitiously transmitted to Facebook as they communicated with their healthcare provider. Indeed, Defendant has only now just started notifying Plaintiffs and Class Members about the disclosure of their PII and PHI to Facebook, meaning their information has been in the possession of and utilized by Facebook for possibly years before Defendant warned them. <P><P>As a proximate result of Defendant's acts and omissions, the private and sensitive PII and PHI of Plaintiffs and the Class Members was disclosed to a third party without authorization, causing Plaintiffs and the Class to suffer damages.<P><P>Plaintiffs and the Class Members sought for an award of damages, including, but not limited to, actual, consequential, punitive, and nominal damages; for an award of attorneys' fees, costs, and litigation expenses; for prejudgment interest on all amounts awarded; and such other and further relief as this Court may deem just and proper.<P><P>On October 4, 2022, Plaintiffs request the Court consolidate all cases under the first-filed action, Curry, et al., v.

After an internal investigation, which commenced shortly after the discovery of the unauthorized activity, Check Point determined that the malicious activity in the Check Point environment related to the SolarWinds Compromise occurred at specific points during a four-month period from July through October 2020, and that this activity included communications with the threat actor's command-and-control server and execution of unauthorized software, including data compression software often used before data exfiltration. Through the internal investigation, Check Point further determined that two Check Point corporate accounts had been compromised. The investigation also revealed instances of the threat actors attempting to move laterally in the Check Point environment.<P><P>On October 22, 2024, the Securities and Exchange Commission imposed the company a penalty in the amount of $995,000 for data security violations.",

The data leak, which took place over three months from June 18, 2020 to September 10, 2020, made headlines when a security researcher revealed that the personal information of about 100,000 Razer customers could have been exposed.<P><P>Experts appointed by both companies agreed that the cybersecurity breach on June 18 was caused by a security misconfiguration, security settings for the ELK Stack being manually disabled, that same day. The management team became aware of the breach on September 9, 2020.<P><P>Razer is claiming at least US$7 million (S$9.85 million) in losses from the vendor, French multinational info-technology company Capgemini. It includes a significant loss of profits, costs incurred in investigating and responding to the incident and costs incurred by corresponding and dealing with regulators. <P><P>According to The Straits Times, Razer paid US$60,000 for a forensic expert to investigate the incident, about US$320,000 to engage a law firm to deal with regulators, and a US$2,000 payment to cyber-security consultant Bob Diachenko, who discovered the breach.",

This allegedly happened several times during a period of four years. The plaintiff maintains that these repeated calls were a distraction, inconvenient and caused him to become angry, frustrated and anxious.

        "description": "On March 5, 2020, a class action complaint was filed by Daniel Beckman (Plaintiff) against Robinhood Financial, LLC, Robinhood Markets, Inc. and Robinhood Securities, LLC (Defendants) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The action arises out of Defendant's negligence and failure to maintain adequate infrastructure.<P><P>According to the complaint, Defendant is an online brokerage firm founded in 2013 that touts itself as a pioneer in commission-free investing. Defendant's customers place securities trades through the firm's website, by using a web-based application. Unfortunately, on March 2, 2020, Defendant's trading systems completely crashed and experienced a total outage of its operating systems. On March 3, 2020, a spokesperson of Defendant admitted that the cause of the outage was instability in a part of their infrastructure that allows their systems to communicate with each other.<P><P>According to Defendant's blog post, the cause of the outage was stress on their infrastructure which struggled with unprecedented load. That in turn led to a 'thundering herd' effect triggering a failure of our DNS system. Multiple factors contributed to the unprecedented load that ultimately led to the outages. The factors included, among others, highly volatile and historic market conditions; record volume; and record account sign-ups.<P><P>As a result of the outage and Defendant's conduct, Plaintiff and the class suffered losses in their trading accounts and damages and continues to expose them to harm. Upon information, Class members number in the hundreds of thousands and up to ten million.<P><P>Plaintiff brought the action individually and on behalf of all customers of Defendant within the United States who were not able to execute trades on options that expired during the Outage.<P><P>Plaintiff sought for an order certifying the case as a class action, declaratory and injunctive relief to enjoin Defendant from engaging in the unlawful practices, compensatory damages, punitive damages, pre- and post-judgment interest, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses and costs of suit and further relief as the Court may deem proper.<P><P>On July 14, 2020, the Court consolidated related cases: 3:20-cv-01769-JD, 3:20-cv-01800-JD, 3:20-cv-01877-JD, 3:20-cv-01909-JD, 3:20-cv-02286-JD, 3:20-cv-02343-JD, 3:20-cv-02352-JD, 3:20-cv-02594-JD, 3:20-cv-02665-JD, 3:20-cv-02669-JD, 3:20-cv-03218-JD and 3:20-cv-03550-JD to the current proceeding (20-cv-01626-JD).<P><P>On August 21, 2020, a consolidated class action complaint was filed by the Plaintiffs.<P><P>On May 26, 2022, the parties have jointly notified the Court that they have reached a settlement in principle resolving the action.<P><P>On August 5, 2022, a Motion for Preliminary Approval of Proposed Class Action Settlement was filed by Plaintiffs. Wherein, Defendant has agreed to pay $9,900,000 non-reversionary cash settlement on behalf of approximately 150,000 investors who experienced losses associated with the March 2020 outages.<P><P>Under the settlement agreement, the Class Members will recover just under 50% of their calculated losses. The Settlement Administration Expenses shall not exceed $400,000 and will be paid out of the Settlement Fund. Plaintiffs will seek Service Awards no more than $2,500 per Plaintiff, which amounts to $37,500 in total. Class Counsel will also receive Attorneys' Fees and Expenses no more than 30% of the Settlement Fund (or no more than $2,970,000) in Attorneys' Fees and up to $1,120,000 in unreimbursed expenses.<P><P>On December 2, 2022, the Court preliminarily approved the class action settlement.<P><P>On March 27, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their notice of motion for final approval of the class action settlement.",

FINRA considered the widespread and significant harm suffered by customers, including millions of customers who received false or misleading information from the firm, millions of customers affected by the firm's systems outages in March 2020, and thousands of customers the firm approved to trade options even when it was not appropriate for the customers to do so.<P><P>The sanctions represent the largest financial penalty ever ordered by FINRA and reflect the scope and seriousness of the violations. FINRA found in its investigation that, despite Robinhood's self-described mission to 'de-mystify finance for all,' during certain periods since September 2016, the firm has negligently communicated false and misleading information to its customers. The false and misleading information concerned a variety of critical issues, including whether customers could place trades on margin, how much cash was in customers' accounts, how much buying power or 'negative buying power' customers had, the risk of loss customers faced in certain options transactions, and whether customers faced margin calls.<P>",

Customers additionally grant Defendant access to sensitive information including but not limited to their names, social security numbers, and dates of birth, mailing addresses, telephone numbers, bank account numbers, and details of their income, bank account balances, financial transactions histories, credit histories, tax information and credit scores.<P><P>On July 22, 2020, Defendant negligently and illegally allowed a third-party access to Melta's personal and financial information, access to the funds Mehta had deposited into a Defendant account, and control of securities positions Mehta purchased through Defendant. As a consequence of the incident, Mehta lost tens of thousands of dollars. Defendant neglected to inform Mehta of the breach and only acknowledged the breach occurred after Mehta has spent hours of his own time attempting to research and remedy the loss and securing his other assets and information from further breach.<P><P>In the summer of 2020, perhaps even earlier, unauthorized users accessed approximately 2,000 Defendant customer accounts. Upon accessing the accounts, these users obtained Defendant's customers sensitive personal and financial information and looted funds. Panicked customers who saw their accounts draining attempted to contact Defendant by email, as Defendant offers no phone number for customer service, and were left waiving for days or weeks while more funds were depleted from their accounts. The breach cost Defendant 's customers millions of dollars. Rather than freezing the accounts and alerting its customers of the breach right away, Defendant did nothing. Only when the news outlets reported on the breach did Defendant acknowledge it had occurred. On October 16, 2020, after breaches had been widely reported by news outlets, Defendant sent push notifications to customers encouraging them to enable two-factor authentication, which is a security setting requiring the use of a password combined with a temporary passcode sent to a mobile device to log on. On information and belief, approximately 2,000 Defendant customers were subject to unauthorized use of their accounts.<P><P>Plaintiff sought monetary and equitable relief as a class action, actual and compensatory damages, restitution, pre- and post-judgement interest, attorney's fees, costs, expenses and further relief as the Court my deem just and proper.<P><P>On February 9, 2021, the case was removed from the Circuit Court to the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.<P><P>On February 26, 2021, Plaintiff Mehta amended his complaint adding Kevin Qian and Michael Furtado as Plaintiff.<P><P>On May 20, 2021, Plaintiffs filed their second amended class action complaint.<P><P>On July 1, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement. Defendants have agreed to pay all individuals currently residing in the United States whose Robinhood accounts were accessed by unauthorized users from January 1, 2020, through April 27, 2022, or who notified Robinhood that their Robinhood accounts were accessed by unauthorized users from January 1, 2020, through April 27, 2022. The settlement provides common benefits to the class with a total value of $20,000,000.<P><P>Under the settlement agreement, Settlement Class Members who submit a valid claim will receive up to $100 for out-of-pocket expenses resulting from unauthorized access to their accounts. Class Members who submit a valid claim will also receive up to $100 for reimbursement of money paid by the Class Member for credit monitoring or identity theft protection products or services. And all Settlement Class Members who submit a valid claim are eligible to receive reimbursement for lost time resulting from unauthorized access to their accounts. The reimbursement will be paid at $20 per hour for a maximum of three (3) hours (for a maximum payment of $60). The maximum aggregate number of claims for which Robinhood shall be responsible to pay is $500,000 plus two years of credit monitoring and identity theft protection services to all Class Members.<P><P>Additionally, Class Counsel will receive attorneys' fees $484,540 and reimbursement of litigation costs totaling $15,460. Plaintiffs Qian and Furtado will also receive service awards in the amount of $5,000 each. The settlement will also be used to pay administration costs for approximately $55,000 to $65,000.<P><P>On August 29, 2022, the Court preliminarily approved the class action settlement.<P><P>On March 17, 2023, Plaintiffs filed their motion for final approval of the class action settlement.<P><P>On May 16, 2023, the Court finally approved the class action settlement and fees.

(SAP Asia) had disclosed the payroll information of some of its former employees to the wrong email recipients. Thereafter, PDPC commenced investigations into the Incident. <P><P>According to the Personal Data Protection Commission (PDPC), SAP Asia had engaged an external vendor to provide IT solutions for their human resources and payroll system (HR System). SAP Asia's process of issuing payslips to their employees had been automated as part of the HR System. However, when payslips needed to be issued to individuals who had already left the company, this could not be done via the HR System. SAP Asia was keen to automate the process of issuing payslips to former employees as part of the HR System, and sometime around April 2019, requested the Vendor to develop a new program within the HR System for this purpose.<P><P>On March 31, 2020, SAP Asia executed the new program to generate and deliver payslips to 43 former employees at their personal email addresses. As the program had not been designed to be able to properly execute multiple payslip issuance, the execution of the new program resulted in 29 out of the 43 former employees receiving their own payslip as well as the payslips of other employees. The personal data of 43 former employees of SAP Asia was improperly disclosed in the incident. The disclosed personal data comprised each of the former employees' name, NRIC or FIN number, employment number, bank account number, monthly basic salary, detailed breakdown of current payment, and year-to-date earnings and deductions.<P><P>On July 30, 2021, a financial penalty of $13,500 was imposed on SAP Asia for failing to put in place reasonable security arrangements to protect personal data of its former employees.",

Threat actors have locked agency's emails and contact centers and are demanding a ransom to unlock them. <P> <P>National Cyber Security Centre and Scotland Police are investigating the whole incident and it is believed that the international cybercriminal group is behind the ransomware attack. Cybersecurity experts have unearthed that threat actors have stolen nearly 1.2 GB of data which suggests threat actors may have accessed and stolen 4,000 files. <P> <P>SEPA said they must start from scratch and build a whole new system following a 'significant cyber-attack'. Agency further stated that essential services regarding food forecasting and warnings have not been hit by cyber-attack. Though it remains highly unlikely that 1,300 employees will be able to secure access to their old emails and online documents. <P> <P>Scotland's environmental regulator has termed this attack as an 'incredibly sophisticated attack' and warned threat actors to face the consequences. We are aware that threat actors are demanding a ransom to unlock the agency's system, but they will not succeed in their plan. <P> <P>The Conti ransomware group asserted the attack and has already leaked sensitive information on its site. The stolen information includes personal information associated with SEPA employees and information associated with commercial work with international allies. <P> <P>Figures released to BBC Scotland under freedom of information laws show a total of GBP 790,000 ($1,085,452.10) has been spent on Sepa's response and recovery actions so far.

Defendant first learned the unusual activity on August 10, 2020. Defendant's investigation revealed its network had been infiltrated by a malware attack and that its inadequate cyber and data security systems and measures allowed cybercriminals to obtain files containing a treasure trove of thousands of Defendant employees' personal, private, and sensitive information including employees' names, addresses, Social Security numbers, benefits enrollment information, salary or hourly rate, and for those employees who used direct deposit bank accounts and routing numbers.<P><P>The attack caused Defendant to halt access to employee email and stop sharing real-time travel information with riders. Upon information, Defendant notified roughly 9,300 employees about the incident. As a result of Defendant's poor cyber and data security systems and measures, Plaintiff and the Class have suffered loss and damages including out-of-pocket expenses, loss of privacy, anxiety, and emotional distress.<P><P>Plaintiff brought the action individually and on behalf of all persons Defendant sent direct-mail notification to about the August 2020 Data Breach Incident regarding the potential compromise of their personal information.<P><P>Plaintiff sought for a class certification, actual, compensatory, and consequential damages, pre-judgment and post-judgment interest, and other relief as the Court deems just and proper.<P><P>On November 18, 2021, Plaintiff filed her second amended class action complaint.<P><P>On January 18, 2023, Plaintiff filed her third amended class action complaint adding Keysha Capers as Plaintiff.<P><P>On February 2, 2023, Plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of the class action settlement. In which, Defendant has agreed to settle the case to resolve claims that it failed to prevent an August 2020 data breach that compromised employee data.<P><P>Under the settlement, Settlement Class members will receive credit monitoring at no cost if they elect to enroll that will last for one year. Second, Settlement Class members a chance to claim losses from the breach, including lost money or time. Members may claim 'economic losses' up to $1,000 for losses resulting from the breach, including identity theft, fraud, and costs spent mitigating those risks. Third, Defendant will pay the entirety of the Costs to administer the settlement. And last, Defendant has confirmed it implemented 'security enhancements' since its data breach, detailing those enhancements in the agreement.<P><P>The total payments to Settlement Class Members shall not exceed $350,000.00, which will include all monetary compensation to be paid to the class as part of this settlement.<P><P>In addition, Class Counsel will receive an award for attorney's fees and costs in the amount up to $275,000. Plaintiffs will also receive service award in the amount of $2,000 each.<P><P>On March 15, 2023, the Court granted the preliminary approval of the class action settlement.<P>",

Milan, also with a long rap sheet, will be sentenced to 15 years. Their codefendant, a 40-year-old Santa Barbara woman named Rosa Bradley, will be given probation for two years for receiving some of the stolen money. <P> <P>Court records reveal the brashness with which Welterlen carried out the scheme. He boasts in text messages to a fourth accomplice named William Gormley, who remains at large, how easy it was for him to steal identities and create fake driver's licenses.  <P> <P>When San Diego police, accompanied by Santa Barbara detectives, arrested Welterlen and Milan at an apartment complex in the Pacific Beach neighborhood, they noticed a computer at the residence was actively hacking an unknown server.

        "description": "Sophisticated hackers, identity thieves and overseas criminal rings stole over $11 billion in unemployment benefits from California last year, but the extent of the fraud might grow far larger: billions more in payments are under investigation. <P> <P>California Labor Secretary Julie Su told reporters in a conference call Monday that of the $114 billion the state has paid in unemployment claims, about 10% or $11.4 billion have been confirmed as fraudulent. <P> <P>Nearly $20 billion more another 17% is considered suspicious, and a large part of that could be found to be fraud, she said. <P> <P>'There is no sugarcoating the reality,' Su said. 'California did not have sufficient security measures in place to prevent this level of fraud, and criminals took advantage of the situation.' <P> <P>Nearly all the fraudulent claims were made through the federally supported Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. The program was approved by Congress to provide unemployment benefits to people during the coronavirus pandemic who are usually ineligible to receive them, such as independent contractors. But, officials say, its broad eligibility requirements made it an easy target of criminals, including from Nigeria and Russia. <P> <P>While conceding the state was unprepared, Su also faulted the Trump administration for failing to provide the state with the guidance and support needed to foil sophisticated fraud rings. She said an array of safeguards put in place last year had blocked billions of dollars in potential fraud schemes. <P> <P>Su described an agency struggling to keep up with a flood of new jobless claims as the pandemic shuttered businesses and sent unemployment rates soaring. And that reservoir of new money was also a lure for criminal enterprises. <P> <P>'It should be no surprise that EDD was overwhelmed, just like the rest of the nation's unemployment agencies,' Su said. 'As millions of Californians applied for help, international and national criminal rings were at work behind the scenes working relentlessly to steal unemployment benefits using sophisticated methods of identity theft.' <P> <P>The state also has been trying to clear a persistent backlog of claims more than 940,000 as of Jan. 20. <P> <P>Officials noted the fraud problems were widespread in the U.S.",

The Danish Civil Agency became aware of the breach on August 26, 2020, but did not report the breach to the DPPA.<P><P>In its assessment, the DDPA has emphasized that encryption of removable storage devices that contain personal data (including USB connectors) must be regarded as a necessary and required security measure. In continuation of this, the DDPA has attached importance to the fact that removable storage means with personal data have a sharpened risk profile in relation to the handling of personal data, and that encryption is a measure that is relatively easy for the data controller to implement. In addition, the DDPA has emphasized that the agency did not have guidelines targeted and known by the agency's case officers in relation to any handling of USB connectors, including dispatch.<P><P>As a result, National Board of Health and Welfare was fined as a result of its failure to implement adequate security measures in the form of encryption with regards to its portable media devices.",

Plaintiff claimed that an unauthorized charge was made to his checking account following the breach. The breach occurred late on September 25, 2020 after a university employee fell victim to a phishing attack in which the employee clicked a link and exposed their credentials to a malicious actor.

Plaintiffs in the case also challenged New London's handling of the data breach and how long it took the hospital to inform affected consumers of the breach.<P><P>According to the data breach class action lawsuit, New London Hospital is responsible for the losses and damages experienced by patients following the data breach. The hospital previously attempted to dismiss the class action lawsuit, but the court did not make a ruling before the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint.<P><P>A settlement has been reached in a class action lawsuit against New London Hospital Association, Inc. d/b/a New London Hospital and Newport Health Center (New London Hospital) relating to the potential compromise of private information of current and/or former patients of New London Hospital on or about July 30, 2020 (Data Incident). <P><P>New London Hospital hasn't admitted any wrongdoing but agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle these allegations.<P><P>On July 7, 2022, a settlement agreement is entered into by and between the parties.<P><P>Under the settlement agreement, New London Hospital or its insurer shall make available the following compensation to Settlement Class Members: settlement class members will be eligible for compensation for unreimbursed ordinary losses, up to a total of $500.00 per claimant, upon submission of a valid Claim Form and supporting documentation, if applicable; Class Members will also be eligible to submit a claim for a statutory benefit; All Class Members who submit a claim shall be awarded $125.00.

No tuition, grant, donation, state or taxpayer funds were used to pay the ransom, the school said.<P><P>A university spokesperson told Threatpost that they have since received the decryption key.<P> <P>The cyber criminals encrypted about 0.02% of the data stored there before the U.'s Information Security Office detected the attack. The university did not specify the threat, but ransomware attacks involve criminal groups that hack into and steal data; encrypt it so that its owners cannot access it; and demand payment to release the data -- often threatening to release sensitive information if their demands are not met. <P> <P>The police were contacted, and the university engaged 'an outside consultant with expertise in handling these types of situations.' <P> <P>The affected servers were isolated from the rest of the university and the internet. The servers were cleaned, and college data was reinstalled from system backups. But because it included employee and student information and after careful consideration, the ransom was paid as a proactive and preventive step to ensure information was not released on the internet. <P> <P>Ten days after the attack, students, staff and faculty were told to change their university passwords. According to the university, the delay was because there had to be a full understanding of what information may have been stolen and how access was gained as it worked with law enforcement to determine what steps should be taken.",

        "description": "The University of Vermont (UVM) health network is scrambling to recover its systems after a cyberattack led to widespread delays in patient appointments. The cyberattack was first launched the week of October 25, 2020. On October 28, the hospital IT staff noticed abnormal activity, and shut down its online operations. The hack downed hospital phone and email networks, eliminating access to patient records and appointments - including chemotherapy appointments, as well as mammograms and biopsies, and halted access for the hospital to pay employee's overtime.<P><P>According to local reports, the attack came through the hospital's main computer server, and impacted its entire system. Since then, the FBI and the Vermont National Guard have been brought in to review thousands of end-user computers and devices, to ensure that they are free of malware. In an update, the UVM health network said that it made significant progress overnight to restore behind-the-scenes components that will aid in the restoration of additional patient-facing systems.<P><P>The UVM's electronic medical records system is up and running nearly a month after the hospital fell victim to a cyberattack. According to Al Gobeille, a vice president of operations for the UVM, the hospital tech team restored Epic health records system, giving doctors and nurses full access to patient medical history, appointments, and medication.<P><P>According to the reports, the October 2020 ransomware attack on the University of Vermont Medical Center has reportedly cost more than $1.5 million per day in lost revenue and increased expenses, according to hospital president Stephen Leffler, not including the cost of getting its systems back up and running. The attack occurred on October 28, 2020 and 42 days later losses continue to be experienced.<P><P>During the breach, nearly 1,300 servers were compromised on more than 5,000 devices across the UVM Health Network. Hospital officials stated that while no patient or employee information was stolen, the process cost them $65 million.<P><P>Gentile's reconstruction provided the first glimpse into the cause of the cyberattack, which crippled Vermont's largest hospital for weeks. In the nearly two months following the hack, hospital officials have remained tight-lipped about the perpetrators and methods of the attack, citing an ongoing investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation.<P><P>On August 5, 2021, a UVM Health Network official said that the cyberattack happened after an employee opened a personal email on a company laptop while on vacation.<P><P>The email contained an attachment that had the malware. When the employee returned from vacation and logged onto the UVM network through a virtual private network, the attackers were ready and launched the attack.<P>",

However, personal information may have been accessible to the cybercriminals including information such as: donor relation to patient, patient discharge status, patient insurance and patient department of service. This database information spans from 2000 to 2020.<P><P>According to court documents, Trinity Health along with its insurer, Aspen Specialty Insurance Company, incurred $2,317,432.39, plus interest, and continue to accrue because of the ongoing fallout of the incident. This cost includes implementation of new data retention protocols and build a new process to handle patients and donors opting-out from future contact.<P>",

The attorney's fees would pay Class Counsel for investigating the facts, litigating the case, and negotiating the Settlement. After attorney's fees and costs, Service Awards (up to $2,500 for each of the 20 class representatives) and expenses for the Settlement Administrator (up to $779,500) are deducted, the Settlement Fund will be used to pay the benefits to the Settlement Class Members.

It shows how even tech-savvy firms can fall victim to 'social engineering' attacks in which hackers impersonate trusted people to trick employees into performing actions harmful to their companies.  <P> <P>In mid-May 2020, Virtu's computer systems were successfully hacked, and, as a result, the hackers obtained unauthorized access to the email account of a Virtu executive. A day later, the hackers logged into the Executive's mailbox via Outlook Web Access and were able to view and read messages in the mailbox to and from the Executive. <P><P>Approximately 13 days later, the hackers created inbox rules that automatically hid certain messages sent from or received in the Executive's inbox. Later, beginning on the same day, pretending to be the Executive, the hackers sent a series of emails from the Executive's email account requesting that Virtu's accounting department issue two wire transfers to overseas banks, one in the amount of approximately $3.6 million, the other in the amount of approximately $7.2 million, for purported capital calls which totaled $10.8 million. Believing the requests to pertain to legitimate, ordinary-course business transactions, Virtu's accounting department complied with the requests. <P><P>After extensive efforts, Virtu's legal team was able to obtain an injunction freezing approximately $3.6 million; and approximately $287,474 in two accounts held within the Bank of China.

The action arises out of data breach incident that affected the Defendants.<P><P>According to the complaint, on March 13, 2020, Defendant ExecuPharm, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Defendant Parexel, suffered a serious data breach whereby third-party hackers gained access to troves of sensitive information maintained on Defendant ExecuPharm's servers and demanded a ransom in exchange for not releasing the information. The stolen information included, among other sensitive information, full names, home addresses, social security numbers, taxpayer IDs, credit card numbers, banking information (including copies of personal checks for direct deposit), driver's licenses, dates of birth, names of spouses and beneficiary information, including their social security numbers, payroll tax forms (such as W-2 and W-4 forms), and in some cases, copies of passports of Defendant ExecuPharm's current and former employees, as well as certain of Defendant Parexel employees whose information was stored on Defendant ExecuPharm's servers. After Defendant ExecuPharm failed to meet the hackers' demands, this information was posted to a dark web website associated with a well-known ransomware group, along with thousands of emails, financial and accounting records, user documents, and database backups.<P><P>Plaintiff brought the action on behalf of all persons whose personal Information was compromised as a result of the data breach and who entered into an employment agreement with Defendant ExecuPharm in which Defendant ExecuPharm promised and agreed to take appropriate measures to protect the confidentiality and security of the employee's personal data.<P><P>Plaintiff sought for class certification, equitable reliefs, damages, including nominal and statutory, attorneys' fees, costs, litigation expenses, prejudgment interest on all amounts awarded and further relief as the Court may deem just and proper.<P><P>On September 4, 2020, the Defendants moved for the dismissal of the complaint for Plaintiff's failure to state a claim upon which relief may be granted.<P><P>On February 25, 2021, the Court ordered the dismissal of the case without prejudice.<P><P>On March 16, 2021, Plaintiff filed a notice of appeal in the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.<P><P>On November 1, 2022, the parties jointly moved the Court to stay the case pending settlement discussions. However, on November 2, 2022, the Court denied the motion to stay.<P><P>On June 22, 2023, counts two, five, six and all claims against Defendant Paraxel was dismissed without prejudice.<P><P>On September 6, 2023, Plaintiff her first amended class action complaint.<P><P>On March 15, 2024, Plaintiff filed a motion for preliminary approval of class action settlement. <P><P>Under the terms of the settlement, Class Members may receive reimbursement of documented out-of-pocket expenses, not to exceed $10,000. Class Members can also submit a claim for reimbursement for documented time spent remedying issues related to the Data Breach for up to five (5) total hours at a rate of $25 per hour capped at $125 ('Documented Lost-Time Claims'). Lastly, Class Members that reside in the state of California as of March 13, 2020, can submit a claim for a one-time payment of $100 in lieu of a claim for reimbursement for Documented Out-of-Pocket Expenses and Lost Time. There will be no cap on total payments made.<P><P>Furthermore, Class Counsel will ask for attorneys' fees award in the amount of $607,910.96, plus expenses of $67,089.04.

Moreover, according to the ruling, Vodafone ruled out any identity theft and verified that the occurrence was caused by a data crossing in their system, which caused the claimant's data to appear as the data of his ex-owner partner's account.<P><P>Furthermore, the resolution emphasizes that Vodafone took the necessary steps during the investigation to cancel the claimant's debt, specifically by issuing a credit note for the amounts that had been invoiced to him, and that once the debt was cancelled, the claimant's personal data was unlinked from his ex-client partner's account, and the claimant's personal data was deleted from Vodafone's system once the debt was cancelled.<P><P>The AEPD noted that the documentation in the file offers evidence that Vodafone had violated Article 6(1) of the GDPR, since it processed the claimant's personal data without having any legitimacy to do so. Furthermore, the AEPD highlighted that, by acknowledging the computer error, Vodafone did not take necessary precautions to prevent these events from occurring.<P><P>Based on the mitigating and aggravating factors, the AEPD deemed it appropriate to impose on Vodafone a penalty of 50,000, for the violation of Article 6(1) of the GDPR.

        "description": "On March 30, 2020, Robert Cullen (Plaintiff) filed a class action lawsuit against Zoom Video Communications, Inc. (Zoom or Defendant) in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The action arises out of Defendant's violation of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA) which protect consumers' personal information from collection and use by businesses without appropriate notice and consent.<P><P>According to the complaint, Zoom users can host or participate in a Zoom videoconference through several means, including the use of the Zoom App for iOS (Apple) devices, an app for Android devices, an app for MacOS, or through a web browser. Zoom boasts its appreciation for the importance of maintaining its users' privacy. However, Zoom has failed to properly safeguard the personal information of the increasing millions of users of its Zoom App and video conferencing platform. Upon installing or upon each opening of the Zoom App, Zoom collects the personal information of its users and discloses, without adequate notice or authorization, this personal information to third parties, including Facebook, Inc. invading the privacy of millions of users in violation of CCPA.<P><P>Plaintiff brought the action on behalf of himself and all persons and businesses in the United States whose personal or private information was collected and/or disclosed by Zoom to a third party upon installation or opening of the Zoom video conferencing application (Class).<P><P>Plaintiff sought for class certification, statutory damages, punitive and treble damages, enjoining Defendant from continuing the illegal activities, reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, pre- and post-judgment interest, and further relief as this Court deems just and proper.<P><P>On May 21, 2020, Plaintiff Cullen filed a stipulation to consolidate Case No.5:20-cv-02155-LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-02170-LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-02376-LHK, Case No.4:20-cv-03078-LHK, Case No 5:20-cv-02520-LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-0259 2-LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-0259 1-LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-02620-LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-0269 1-LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-02861-LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-0289 3-LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-029 39 -LHK, Case No.5:20-cv-03042-LHK, and Case No.5:20-cv-03252-LHK.<P><P>On May 28, 2020, a stipulation to consolidate actions was granted by the Court and on July 30, 2020, a consolidated amended class action complaint. On July 31, 2021, Zoom agreed to pay $85 million (Settlement Fund) and bolster its security practices to settle a lawsuit. Under the terms of the settlement, class members who used the free version of Zoom can claim a $15 class action rebate. Those who paid for a subscription can claim a $25 award or 15 percent of their fees. Class counsel sought attorneys' fees up to 25% of the $85 million Settlement Fund, or $21.25 million, plus out-of-pocket expenses of $130,842.24. Plaintiffs will receive service payments of $5,000 each.<P><P>On October 21, 2021, the Court preliminarily approved the class action settlement. On January 28, 2022, Plaintiffs filed their motion for final approval of class action settlement.<P><P>On April 21, 2022, the Court granted Plaintiffs' motion for final approval and their motion for attorneys' fee and expense award. Accordingly, the Court closed the case.<P>",
